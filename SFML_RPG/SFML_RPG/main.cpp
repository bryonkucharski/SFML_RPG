time stamp 7:40 is important
you may need to copy some .dll files from one place to another inside where your git project is located.
so watching the video from 7:40 on is good to clear some stuff up.

also up top there is a drop down window with x64 x86 and configuration manager left to the compile and run button.
make sure the drop down window says x86
